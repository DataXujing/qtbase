TODO
===================================================

For Qt 5.x:
- Fix custom property support
- Find new t_voidp types and add conversions
- Find new t_class|t_stack types and add explicit coercions if applicable


General:
- Documentation, via QtAssistant.
- Eventually split off the Qt-specific bits, so that there is a
  general "rsmoke" package. It will still depend on Qt, but will not
  do any binding by itself.
